# Behavior-of-Linear-Model-Machine-Learning-Study
Learnt about various linear Model and their behaviour on various kinds od dataset.

# 1. Experiment 1 : Imbalanced Dataset 



 1.1.1  As a part of this experiment we will observe how linear models work in case of data imbalanced, we will observe how hyper plane is changes according to change in  learning rate for both svm and logistic regression.
    
1.1.2    we have created 4 random datasets which are linearly separable and having class imbalance

1.1.3 In the  dataset the ratio between positive and negative is 100 : 2, 100 : 20, 100 : 40, 100 : 80.

# 2. Experiment 2 : Linear Model effect on High Variance Data.

*  In this experiment we will observe how linear models work in case of data having feautres with different variance


# 3. Experiment 3 : Linear Model performance on presence of outliers
*   As a part of this experiment we will be working the regression problem and how regularization helps to get rid of outliers, and we will see how the hyperplane is changing in presence of outliers.
